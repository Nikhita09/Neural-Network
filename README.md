# Neural-Network

From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, we received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received various amounts of funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. We will have to build a machine learning model that will be able to predict the success of a venture paid by Alphabet soup. The trained model will be used to determine the future decisions of the company.

## Analysis

#### Q) How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model?
A) I selected 3 layers for the network model. Initially I had 31 inputs and 64 neurons.

#### Q) Were you able to achieve target model performance?
A) No, I could not go beyond 70%

#### Q) What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
A) Increased number of neurons and removed columns that did not impact the model.

#### Q) If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose and why?
A) I would use logistic regression as it would be easier to transform and fit the model.
